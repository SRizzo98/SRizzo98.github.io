Within his freshman year he obtained high honors as well as a varsity spot on the wrestling team. As Sebastian countined his journey throughout high school, he made his way to Allentown High School. His sophmore year he ran cross country in the fall and began a new varsity wrestling legacy at Allentown in the winter. His legacy had a late begining though since he tore his meniscus mid wrestling match, Sebastian winning 8-2 despite the injury. Junior year at Allentown High School was the peak of Sebastians legacy, both academically and athletically. With receiving honor roll and being healed from his injury, he ran his second year of cross country in the fall and was in great shape for his upcoming wrestling season. Sebastians Junior wrestling year was filled with many accomplishments. He was captian, won MCTs at 120 pds, 2nd at districts at 120, and given the coaches award. Senior year Sebastian challeneged himself in ways he would have never imagined. Not only was he a varsity runner his third cross country season and captian again of his wrestling team, but he was motivated by something much bigger. Sebastian was applying for an NROTC Marine Scholarship to Rutgers University. The application included paperwork, interviews, physical tests, and the dedication to keep moving forward. After 3 months of applying, Sebastian completed his paperwork, was top 10 percent during interviws, scored a 275 out of 300 on the PT test, and could not have been more satisfied. June 2016, he was awarded the Scholarhip and is starting a new chapter in his life at Rutgers University.</p></center>
